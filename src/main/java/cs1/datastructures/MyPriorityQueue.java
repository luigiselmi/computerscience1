/**
 * A Priority queue is a heap-ordered complete binary tree.
 * A binary tree is heap-ordered when the key in 
 * each node is equal or larger than its childrenâ€™s keys. 
 * A priority queue provides two main APIs:
 * 
 * - insert
 * - remove the maximum
 * 
 * Both operations require a number of comparisons
 * proportional to log(n), where n is the number of
 * elements.

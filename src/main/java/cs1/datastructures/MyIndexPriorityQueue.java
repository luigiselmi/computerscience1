/**
 * An index priority queue is a heap-ordered complete binary tree
 * in which each element is associated with a unique integer, or index.
 * An integer array pq is used to store the index associated to each 
 * element heap-ordered. The elements of the index priority queue (aka keys) 
 * are stored in a different array. Another integer array qp is used to 
 * store the position of an element's index in the heap. A binary tree is 
 * heap-ordered when the key in each node is equal or larger than its 
 * childrenâ€™s keys. An index priority queue provides two main APIs:
 * 
 * - insert a key (with its unique index)
 * - remove the maximum key
 * 
 * Both operations require a number of comparisons
 * proportional to log(n), where n is the number of
 * elements.
